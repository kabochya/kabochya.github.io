I am a student from [National Taiwan University(NTU)][ntu], currently studying Electrical Engineering and Finance. I like to mash up knowledge from different areas, even tried to explain microelectronic circuits in words of economics once. This year(2014), as a junior, I have had the chance to join the core team of HackNTU, a hackathon held by students in NTU. The team itself is fabulous, with talented members from different departments, all having great dreams to fulfill. Feeling a rush of blood to my head, I realized that no matter what the outcome is, it will be a exciting time that is worth to keep record in some corner of the world. Therefore, this site is created.

This blog will be used to record things happening from now on, mainly the progress of [HackNTU 2015][hackntu]. If I have any spare time, I will record about the things, events and people I meet that are interesting or worth to be logged down. May the force be with you.
